This is where I learned the basic of redux with react. I created two reducers (but on the site is shown just one): counter and isLogged. The 
counterReducer has two actions: increment and decrement. If you click on the "+", it will increment the number by 5, and if you click "-", it will
decrement by 1. The buttons use the dispatcher. If you want to see the states, you can use redux devtools. I combined the two reducers, by combining them,
creating a store with them and incorporating the app in the Provider.
